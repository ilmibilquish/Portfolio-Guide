# Power BI Projects

| Project | Project Description |
|---|---|
| üõ´ [Tourism Performance Report](https://github.com/ilmibilquish/Power-BI-Projects/blob/main/Tourism-Performance-Report.md) | This Power BI dashboard offers a well-rounded narrative of tourism performance‚Äîstarting with macro indicators and narrowing down to regional and temporal patterns. Each visual contributes a piece to the overall story, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions around marketing, resource allocation, and operational strategy. The dynamic layout and interactivity make it an effective tool for both strategic reviews and day-to-day performance monitoring. |
| üç¨ [Yummy Sweets Sales Analysis](https://github.com/ilmibilquish/Power-BI-Projects/blob/main/Yummy-Sweets-Sales-Analysis.md) | This sales analysis dashboard provides a detailed overview of Yummy Sweets‚Äô performance from January 2021 to January 2022. It highlights key trends in sales, revenue by product category, type, and size, and evaluates the performance of each sales team across different regions. The dashboard offers actionable insights into customer engagement and team productivity, helping to identify top-performing products and markets. These insights are valuable for making informed decisions on inventory management, sales strategy, and supporting underperforming teams to drive overall business growth. |
| üåä [Water Quality Analysis]() | This project conducted a structured data cleaning and preprocessing process to prepare a water quality dataset for accurate analysis. The workflow prioritized resolving missing values first, followed by the detection and correction of outliers. This was achieved using a combination of Power BI's Power Query and Python scripting, resulting in a fully updated and merged dataset for downstream insights. |
| üìã [Ace Digital Employment Training Report]() | Ace Digital Employment Training Report Dashboard provides interactive insights into five years of employee training records. It highlights the distribution of training across time, departments, and locations, evaluates the impact on employee engagement and performance, and reveals training preferences based on employee ratings. The dashboard integrates ArcGIS to map training distribution geographically, helping identify regions with higher or lower training access. This tool supports data-driven decisions to enhance workforce development and training effectiveness. |

# SQL for Data Analysis

| Project | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| ü•â [Applying Fundamental SQL Concepts]() | April 2025 | SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) | This project demonstrates my understanding of foundational SQL techniques used for retrieving and exploring data. It includes writing queries using SELECT * FROM, applying filters with WHERE, sorting results with ORDER BY, and using basic aliases. These core skills are essential for navigating and querying structured databases effectively.|
| ü•à [Applying Intermediate SQL Concepts]() | April 2025 | SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) | This project demonstrates the use of intermediate SQL techniques for analytical and data preparation tasks. It includes data aggregation using GROUP BY with functions like SUM(), AVG(), and COUNT(), combining tables with different types of JOINs, filtering aggregated results using HAVING, and applying conditional logic through CASE and nested CASE statements. It also covers data cleaning and preparation, such as handling NULL values, transforming data formats, and working with various data types to ensure consistency and accuracy.|
| ü•á [Applying Advanced SQL Concepts]() | April 2025 | SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) | This part highlights more complex querying strategies. I worked with subqueries and correlated subqueries to extract data based on multi-step logic, used EXISTS for conditional filtering, and integrated Python's pytest to validate SQL outputs. These advanced techniques are useful for dynamic data extraction, deeper analysis, and integrating SQL within broader data workflows.|

# Python for Data Analysis

| Project | Phase | Project Description | Libraries |    
|---|---|---|---|
| üìù [Data Preprocessing for Analytical Readiness]() | Data Preprocessing | This project demonstrates my ability to perform essential data preprocessing tasks to prepare raw datasets for effective analysis. It includes importing data from various sources, such as CSV and Excel files, followed by thorough data cleaning‚Äîaddressing missing values, correcting data types, removing duplicates, and resolving inconsistencies. I then applied data manipulation techniques, including filtering, sorting, grouping, merging, and reshaping, to structure the data for analysis. These preprocessing steps are critical for ensuring data quality, uncovering early patterns, and setting the foundation for meaningful insights in subsequent stages.. | pandas | 
| üìà [Sales Trends and Insights]() | Data Visualization| This project explores sales data to uncover patterns and trends across days of the week, aiming to support data-driven decision-making. I analyzed daily revenue performance to identify which days generate the highest sales and where operational improvements can be made. The analysis highlights both high-performing days with growth potential and underperforming periods that could benefit from targeted strategies. Through clear visualizations and actionable insights, this project provides a foundation for optimizing sales efforts, improving efficiency, and guiding strategic business decisions. | pandas, matplotlib |   
| üí° [Business Insights and Recommendation]() | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) | This project focuses on a sales dataset to uncover meaningful patterns and insights. The process involved identifying and handling anomalies to ensure data accuracy, followed by generating visualizations to explore trends, outliers, and relationships within the data. I examined key sales metrics and customer behaviors, laying the groundwork for deeper analysis. This assessment not only highlights my ability to clean and interpret data but also emphasizes the importance of drawing actionable conclusions from visual and statistical exploration. | pandas, matplotlib, seaborn |

# Python Challenges and Exercises

| Project | Project Description |
|---|---|
| üéÆ [FizzBuzz in Python: Building and Testing with Pytest]() | This project involves building a simple FizzBuzz application in Python and writing unit tests using Pytest to validate the program's logic. It demonstrates core skills in control flow, function design, and test-driven development. |
| üñ±Ô∏è [Build a calculator]() | This project involves building a simple calculator using Python that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The goal was to enhance functionality and user experience by improving input handling and error checking. This hands-on exercise helped strengthen my understanding of control flow, functions, and user input in Python. |
| ü§ñ [AI Prompt Engineering and Data Privacy for Insights]() | Practise anonymising sensitive data creatively and then use AI chatbox engine to calculate insights from the anonymised dataset. The goal is to protect sensitive information while still enabling meaningful analysis. |
| üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë [Understanding Sampling Methods Through Python]() | This project explores various sampling methods using Python to understand how samples are drawn from a population for statistical analysis. It covers techniques such as random sampling, systematic sampling, stratified sampling, and  cluster sampling. Through hands-on examples, I demonstrated how different sampling approaches affect data representation and analysis, laying the foundation for accurate and reliable statistical inference. |
| üëì [Exploring Hypotheses Using Z, T, and Chi-Square Tests in Python]() | This project focuses on understanding and applying statistical hypothesis testing using Python. It covers key concepts such as null and alternative hypotheses and demonstrates how to perform Z-tests, T-tests, and Chi-square tests. Through practical examples, I explored how to validate assumptions, compare groups, and draw data-driven conclusions using real-world datasets. |
